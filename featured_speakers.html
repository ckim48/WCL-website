I am the former Round Square leader, Vice-President of the Black and Brown Student Union, and recently the intern for the Gandhi Smriti and Darshan Samiti Foundation. My presentation will be about recognizing the need for diversity among leaders, both neurologically and racially and the importance of not only equality but equity as well  while leading. </p>

               <p>
                  Neurologically as in having leaders that are both neurotypical and neurodivergent. The importance of this is that it creates a better environment to not only lead but also create leaders. Additionally, equity is important in leading. It gives an opportunity for leaders and co-leaders to focus on the needs of those they’re leading. Equity allows leaders to make sure that resources and support are divided to support individual needs within their group.

                You have your own unique brand of values, gifts, and experience. These are your building blocks for powerful leadership. You have the power to lead by example, to lift up those around you, and to be the change you wish to see in the world just by choosing how you interact with others and the energy you bring. In this session we will discuss how to identify and center around your personal values, the core premises of energy leadership, and tangible ways to step into to more conscious interaction with the world around you. How will you use your superpower?

                    <p> My name is Seblewongel, the Gender and Social Specialist at the Green Climate Fund. My husband and our two daughters- who attend Chadwick International - moved to South Korea three years ago and we love it here.</p>

                    <p> My work to date is about highlighting the importance of addressing gender inequality issues and to address the barriers to equality. Our engagement at the GCF is about, ensuring equal opportunities and benefits are provided to both women and men, as impacts of climate change impact all. We also acknowledge the differentiated and disproportionate impacts climate change has on women and have a policy to address that. </p>

                    <p> I strongly believe that leadership should be inclusive. Each one of us are leaders in our own rights. Some of us will be known across the globe, in our respective countries, in our communities and some of us in our schools, homes and amongst our peers. Some of us do not consider ourselves as leaders, but spend our lives raising, supporting and nurturing leaders. Some have the enabling environment to be leaders I consider those of us here have better opportunity to acknowledge, discover and nurture the leader in us. My presentation tries to draw a parallel between how in a school, leaders are nurtured and how we at the GCF are trying to contribute towards nurturing leaders, particularly women leaders, through our investments. </p>
